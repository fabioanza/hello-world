# hello-world
Trial repository, as per guide :D
Hi, my name is Fabio Anza and this is me following the "Hello-World" guide to learn about GitHub. In November 2018 I joined Prof. Crutchfield research group at UC Davis and I started learning Python and coding more.
I will be using GitHub mostly for my own scientific interests as Quantum Physics, Information Theory and the theory of Dynamical Systems.
